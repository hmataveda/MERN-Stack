how to to server Side

in terminal
1. do npm i -y for package.json file
2. create server.js file
3. npm in express and mongoose , cors
4. in serverjs file
    1. first do express connections
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();
const PORT = 8000;
app.use(express.json(), express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // body parser

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log("your port is running in 8000!!! hurraaaaaaaaayyyyy");
});

2. then do mongoose connection to js

mongoose
  .connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp", {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log(
      "Mongoose connection is established with mongooose!!!!!!!! great"
    );
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log("Something went wrong when connecting to the database ", err);
  });


3. then do Schema and models

const StudentSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
  },
  class: {
    type: String,
  },
});

const Student = mongoose.model("Student", StudentSchema);

4. then connect the routes through express and do the queries through schema models

    ex: app.get("/api/students", (req, res) => {
  Student.find()
    .then((result) => {
      res.json({ studebdjnsknts: result });
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      res.json(err);
    });
});


Debug:
*Make sure MongoDB server is running (use mongod command) 
*Make sure post data matches the data being inserted into the database (ex: name, age, etc.)
*Make sure that the form submits to a post request to /collectionNames
*Make sure mongoose is actually installed
*Check the order of everything related to mongoose (require → connect → Schema → Model → route)
Use lots of console.log statements to follow the data
